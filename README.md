**👋 Hi! My name is Rasak, a Data Analyst driving impact by transforming complex data into actionable insights that help top organizations and small-to-medium enterprises boost efficiency, strengthen decision-making, and achieve sustainable growth. Backed by a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Political Science (with distinction), I combine analytical rigor with strategic perspective to deliver meaningful results.**

I exclusively focus on end-to-end data workflows from data collection and cleaning, through exploratory analysis and feature engineering, to visualization and early-stage modeling. My goal is to transform raw, unstructured data into actionable insights that enable smarter, data-driven decisions across business domains. 

I bring proficiency in **Python, R, and SQL** alongside hands-on experience with **Power BI, Tableau**, and **Excel**. I design scalable pipelines that automate data ingestion, wrangling, and dashboarding.

🔧**Core Skills**
**Data Collection**: APIs, SQL queries, web scraping, Excel files, and automated pipelines (Airflow and cron jobs).

**Data Processing**: Python (Pandas, NumPy), R (dplyr, tidyr), Spark, ETL design, data cleansing.

**Data Analysis**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, A/B testing, correlation analysis, forecasting, regression.

**Data Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn, D3.js, Excel (PivotTables & VBA)

**Tools**: Git, Google Collab, Jypter Notebooks, Google Sheets, Notion, Looker Studio.
